	%\section{Introduction}
	\section{Purpose}
	This document details the system requirements specification (SRS) for an online meeting scheduling system for students and academics, commissioned by the School of Electrical and Information Engineering. The project aims to improve the meeting scheduling process by reducing the manual communication (emails) required to agree upon a meeting time.
	
	\section{Project Scope}
	\subsection{Basic Scope}
	The system will at a minimum allow students to select an academic with whom they would like to meet and view the academic's schedule so that a suitable time can be chosen. New meetings can only be booked during the academic's free calendar time. However a student can request to join an existing meeting. Each meeting has additional details associated with it, such as meeting duration, the type of meeting and meeting details.
	
	The academic (the administrator) must be able to view their schedule and manually book meetings, bypassing the scheduling system. Additionally, the administrator should be able to specify times when they are available, which could be fetched from their Google calender. Administrators should be able to edit their own schedules, while students cannot.
	
	The basic scope is required for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in order to show that the system will provide some value to the School.
	
	\subsection{Extended Scope}
	Once the basic system scope has been implemented, various additional features will be developed, such as: being able to reschedule meetings, create waiting lists when desired time slots are not available, scheduling rules and integrating with Google Calender.
	
	\section{Project Overview}
	\subsection{Assumptions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All meeting requesters are members of the School of Electrical and Information Engineering
		\item All meeting requests are valid, i.e., a student will not book  a meeting for a course in which he is not enrolled
		\item Meetings will run according to the meeting schedule
		\item Academics will not change their free time after a meeting has been scheduled
		\item All meetings will take place in the lecturer's office
		\item Adequate storage is available to run the system for the foreseeable future
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No dedicated server-side web development frameworks may be used
		\item Python must be used as the server-side scripting language
		\item The Apache Web Server must be used
		\item The shared Git repository on the provided server must be used
	\end{itemize}

	
	
	\section{System Features}
	
	\subsection{High Level User Stories (Epics)}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{View a schedule: }
		An academic can view his own schedule on a calender
		\item \textbf{Book a meeting bypassing the scheduling system: }
		An academic can book meetings directly in case a student does not make use of the online scheduling system
		\item \textbf{Book a meeting with an academic: }
		Students can request to meet when an academic is available, and can set details about the meeting
		\item \textbf{Allocate free time for meetings: }
		An academic can select time slots when he is available to meet
		\item \textbf{Join an existing meeting: }
		Students can join an existing meeting if this is allowed by the academic
		\item \textbf{Cancel a meeting: }
		Students can cancel a meeting such that the time slot becomes clear
		\item \textbf{Set meetings to recur: }
		An academic can set certain meetings to repeat over a certain period
		\item \textbf{View reports of time spent on meetings: }
		An academic can view reports summarising time spent in meetings and with whom
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Low Level User Stories}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Book a meeting with an academic: }
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A student must select an academic to meet with
			\item A student must enter his name and student number, the meeting subject and meeting duration
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Allocate free time for meetings: }
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An academic can set periods of time when he is available to meet
			\item (An academic can set recurring periods of time when he is available to meet)
			\item (An academic can set periods of free time to repeat so that they don't need to enter the same periods multiple times)
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{View reports of time spent on meetings: }
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The academic can set the time period of the report so they can view meeting summaries over that period
			\item The academic can filter by type of meeting so that they can view a summary of a particular type of meeting
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

			\hline
			\textbf{Use Case} & \textbf{Book a meeting with an academic}\\
			\hline
			\hline
			Description & The purpose of this feature is to enable users within the faculty to book a meeting with a specific academic\\
			\hline
			Primary Actor & Student or academic\\
			\hline

				\item University - wants to view all booked appointments
				\end{enumerate}\\
				\hline
				Precondition& The user is registered on the system and is on the required webpage\\
				\hline
				Minimal Guarantee& The student will be able to determine if a selected timeslot is available or not\\
				\hline
				Success Guarantee & The academic, student, and school administration can view that the academic was available for discussion within the selected timeslot and the meeting has therefore been booked\\
				\hline

					\hline
					Extensions & The user is not available during the free times allocated by the academic. Renegotiate meeting time\\
					\hline
					Variations & User may contact the academic directly (for example via email or SMS) in order to request a meeting and the academic therefore directly accesses the system and books the meeting for the user\\
					\hline
					Schedule &  Due date : Release 1.0\\
					\hline
					Open Issues &  \begin{itemize}
						\item What if the academic does not allocate any free time?
						\item What if the student requires an urgent meeting?

			\hline
			Minimal Guarantee & The system generates a report with the basic information in the calender, regardless whether a specified period is given or not. \\
			\hline
			Success Guarantee & The system generates a compressed form of the academics meetings, in which it is displayed to the academic through the platform.\\
			\hline
			Main Success Scenario & 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Academic opens calender and selects the summary report option
				\item The system prompts the user to enter a time period that the academic would like a summary for
				\item The academic enters the dates for the desired period
				\item The system exacts data from the given time period
				\item The system places the extracted data into a simple format that summarises the meetings
				\item The system displays the summarised meetings to the academic through the same platform
			\end{enumerate}
			\\ 
			\hline
			Extensions & 1.a. Academic is unable to open the calender due to bad internet connection: \\
			& Open the calender at a later stage when internet connection is available\\
			& 2.a. System unresponsive and does not prompt for user input: \\
			& Academic must resubmit request \\
			& 3.a. Academic submits the wrong period dates \\
			& generate report and then allow user to resubmit the period \\
			& 4.a. System is unable to exact information: \\
			& Generate error message to both academic and system administrator\\
			\hline
			Variations & Given that the system is heavily reliant on the database of the system there is no variations\\
